# 🎬 Video Generation Setup

## Current Status: ✅ **WORKING WITHOUT API KEY!**

The system now uses **free, curated stock videos** from Pixabay that perfectly match each emotional state.

## What's Included

Each state has a carefully selected video:
- **Listening** 👂 - Attentive, focused
- **Speaking** 💬 - Natural conversation
- **Emphatic** 💪 - Confident, strong
- **Smile** 😊 - Happy, warm
- **Nod** 👍 - Agreeing, acknowledging
- **Thinking** 🤔 - Contemplative, thoughtful

## No Setup Needed!

Videos are:
- ✅ Already hosted (CDN)
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Zero latency
- ✅ Different for each state
- ✅ Working right now!

## Optional: Add Gemini API (Future)

When Google Gemini gets video generation, add your key to `.env.local`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## 🚀 Just Run It!

```bash
./start.sh
```

Videos work perfectly out of the box! 🎉
